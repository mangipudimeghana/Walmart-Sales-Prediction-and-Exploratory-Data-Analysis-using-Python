# Problem Statement

In this project we are provided with the weekly sales data for their various outlets from Walmart stores. Use predictive modeling techniques to forecast the sales. Use statistical analysis, EDA, outlier analysis and handle the missing values to come up with various insights that can give a clear perspective on the following :

a. If the weekly sales are affected by the unemployment rate, if yes - which stores
are suffering the most?
b. If the weekly sales show a seasonal trend, when and what could be the reason?
c. Does temperature affect the weekly sales in any manner?
d. How is the Consumer Price index affecting the weekly sales of various stores?
e. Top performing stores according to the historical data.
f. The worst performing store, and how significant is the difference between the
highest and lowest performing stores.
